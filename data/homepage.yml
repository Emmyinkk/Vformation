    text: "A dental practice is a business with unique financial challenges that call for skilled expertise. Yet as a dentist, nearly all of your training was focused on dental treatments. PracticeCFO can take much of the financial decision-making burden off your plate, giving you more time to see patients and enjoy your life."

Transferring ownership, whether to a family member or buyer, is complicated. PracticeCFO can craft a succession plan that ensures a smooth transition and satisfies all stakeholders.

Additionally, PracticeCFO can guide you through the acquisition process of buying a dental practice. We’ve helped hundreds of dentists do just that. We also have an excellent financial training program for dental associates aspiring to be practice owners at www.associatesonfire.com."
